To seed the files, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project root i.e. the top folder where client and server folders live

2. Run the command npm install.  (I have had to acquire additional npm packages, npm install will get these for you.)

3. Run the command npm install -g node-mongo-seeds

4. Run the command: node server/db/run_seed.js

5. run the command: seed

5. open mongodb compass application (equivalent of postico for sql) and look at the collection "cities"

6. celebrate and party!
